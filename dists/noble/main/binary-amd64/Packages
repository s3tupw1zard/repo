Description: VoIP chat for online gaming
 TeamSpeak is a quality, scalable application which enables people to speak
 with one another over the Internet. TeamSpeak consists of both client and
 server software. The server acts as a host to multiple client connections,
 capable of handling literally thousands of simultaneous users. This results
 in an Internet based teleconferencing solution that works in a variety of
 applications such as team mates speaking with one another while playing
 their favorite online game, small businesses cutting costs on long distance
 charges, or for personal communication with friends and family.
 .
 This package contains the graphical TeamSpeak6 Beta client.

Description: Fish-like fast/unobtrusive autosuggestions for zsh
 As you type commands, you will see a completion offered after the cursor
 in a muted gray color. If you press the right-arrow key or End with the
 cursor at the end of the buffer, it will accept the suggestion, replacing
 the contents of the command line buffer with the suggestion. If you invoke
 the forward-word widget, it will partially accept the suggestion up to the
 point that the cursor moves to.
